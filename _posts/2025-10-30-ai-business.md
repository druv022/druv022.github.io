# “Darkness Before the Dawn”

### TL;DR:

AI is reshaping the world of work faster than ever—collapsing traditional boundaries between data, analysis, and decision-making. Layoffs, even in AI roles, reflect a deeper transformation rather than just a downturn. As automation expands into white-collar domains, success will hinge on learning with AI, not competing against it. Business schools and workplaces alike are evolving to prioritize adaptability, foresight, and the ability to bridge human judgment with machine intelligence. The future belongs to those who can anticipate change, experiment boldly, and lead through this “darkness before the dawn.”

This feels like the most fitting title for this reflection, given the relentless wave of layoff news dominating the headlines. What’s surprising—and unsettling—is that even AI-related roles are not immune. It made me pause and ask: “Are AI jobs even safe?”

Adding to this unease is the unprecedented rise in tech stock valuations, fueling talk of an “AI bubble.” I share that anxiety—not because I doubt AI’s transformative potential, but because of the sky-high expectations and the market’s often irrational exuberance. Many are comparing this moment to the dot-com bubble, but as Bill Gates recently noted, the aftermath of that crash was also the birth of a new era—the exponential growth of the internet we live with today. Perhaps history will rhyme again.

#### Am I Worried?

As my bio says, I’ve spent several years in the software industry, transitioned into applied AI research, and am now pursuing a master’s in Business and Technology. Soon, I’ll be re-entering the job market—ready to contribute to the next wave of value creation. Yet, I can’t ignore the accelerating pace of AI-driven change. Things are moving incredibly fast, and there’s no sign of slowing down.

#### So, What Has Changed?

The evolution from data → information → analysis → decision-making has always relied on human skill at each stage. But today, automation and intelligent systems are collapsing those handoffs, shrinking multi-step processes into single, AI-driven pipelines.

In the past, process innovation aimed to reduce inefficiencies between stages of human handover. Now, AI is not just improving those transitions—it’s replacing them. Reasoning agents and generative systems can now perform complex cognitive work once thought to be uniquely human.

White-collar domains are already feeling the shift:

* Software development is more efficient with AI coding assistants like GitHub Copilot.

* Managers are using AI-driven workflow tools to handle scheduling, prioritization, and reporting.

* Researchers and analysts are leveraging AI to summarize, reason, and generate insights at superhuman speed.

This means “learning skills” in isolation will no longer be enough. The new value lies in knowing how to work with AI—how to orchestrate it as a collaborator, not just use it as a tool.

#### The Academic Shift: Business Schools in Transition

In my two months time in business school till now, I’ve witnessed how deeply AI is now embedded in management education. From vibe coding to AI-powered search, summarization, and simulation tools, classrooms are evolving fast.

The tension is real: the engineer and researcher in me resists this rapid shift, yearning for depth and rigor. Yet, the business lens reminds me of the rationale—progress often prioritizes speed and direction over perfection. As managers, our role isn’t to chase flawless solutions but to make timely, informed decisions in an age of intelligent automation.

#### How Do We Prepare Ourselves?

There’s no single roadmap. Every professional will have a unique mix of skills, ambitions, and motivations. Still, here are my two cents for navigating this fast-changing landscape:

1. Dive deep into AI and augment your craft. Don’t just use AI—guide it. Experiment, learn, and shape how AI enhances your domain.

2. Stay curious and informed. Follow the trends in your field, read critically, and analyze how AI is reshaping your profession. Make small predictions—and test them.

These may sound generic, but they are universal. If you think your domain is untouched by AI, wait a little longer—you’ll be surprised.

#### How Can Future Leaders Prepare Themselves?

Beyond traditional leadership skills, the defining capability of the future manager will be anticipation: the ability to forecast change and adapt intelligently.

No, we can’t literally “see the future,” but we can learn to model it based on what we know today. This is especially true with AI, which is set to transform the workforce more profoundly than any prior technology.

One practice I strongly recommend is to stay informed through reports that analyze cutting-edge trends—such as the [State of AI Report](https://www.stateof.ai/)
. These annual publications provide data-driven insights into the pace of AI research, corporate adoption, and industry impact. Understanding these shifts is not just academic curiosity—it’s a form of career insurance. It helps us anticipate where opportunities and risks will emerge and positions us as informed decision-makers rather than passive observers.

By blending creative foresight with technological awareness, leaders can become what McKinsey calls the “strategic bridge”—professionals who connect business objectives with AI capabilities. This hybrid mindset will be the most defensible and valuable career position in the decade ahead.

In Conclusion

We are standing at the intersection of massive layoffs, soaring AI investments, and a deep transformation of white-collar work. It’s unsettling, yes—but also full of opportunity.

The future will belong to those who learn to think with AI rather than compete against it. As we navigate this “darkness before the dawn,” let’s remember that every technological upheaval has also been a creative rebirth. Those who adapt, learn, and bridge the gap between human judgment and machine intelligence will not only survive—they’ll lead.
