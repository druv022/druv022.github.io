This is the first page of the long journey ahead. I would like to give a brief overview of what to expect in this website. I will periodically update it with posts, ideas, papers, experiments and results. Please don't expect any eye catching or fancy experience. Nevertheless, hope you will like it, get inspired and start exploring world of AI. 

Note:
All codes will be available in my github.

By the way,
``` python
# No this is not enough!
model.train()
# bla bla bla
model.eval()
```
So I will always put my analysis along with my results. I would always appreciate any feedback, positive criticism and corrections.

Thank you!
